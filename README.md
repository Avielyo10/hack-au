# Hack AU

This is a prep repo for the AU hackathon 2019.

## Usage

1. Pull the container: `docker pull avielyosef/hack-au`.

On each user a **README** will guide you through the level (what is needed to solve this stage and also some clue about what we are looking for).  
> **NOTE:** Don't try to use `root` for login, it is disabled on purpose :)
